This program used the intellij IDE to create the project. To use another IDE, you should probably delete the .idea folder
and re-create the project in your own IDE. 
To run, compile the Lab5Driver.java and then run. It will look as though nothing happened, but if you check out the output.txt file, it should
have updated weather results and the area they came from.
